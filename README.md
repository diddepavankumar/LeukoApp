# LeukoApp – Blood Cancer Detection Model

*A Laboratory Testing Application by Shawred Analytics*

## 📌 Overview

LeukoApp is a **deep learning–based diagnostic aid** designed to assist laboratories in the **early detection of blood cancer** by analyzing digitized **peripheral blood smear images**.

Developed under **Shawred Analytics**, this system integrates computer vision with laboratory workflows to provide **scalable, reproducible, and clinically relevant predictions**. The model identifies **abnormal leukocytes and early-stage leukemia patterns**, offering decision support for pathologists and lab technicians.

---

## 🚀 Features

* **Automated Blood Smear Analysis** – Upload blood smear images for instant classification.
* **Cancer Detection Pipeline** – Detects leukemic abnormalities with deep learning models.
* **Streamlit-Powered Interface** – Lightweight and interactive web UI for lab deployment.
* **Laboratory Integration** – Modular design for compatibility with LIS/HIS systems.
* **Scalable Deployment** – Supports **on-premise servers** and **cloud hosting** for multi-lab usage.
